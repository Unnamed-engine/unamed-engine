    /// It implements helper functions that all systems should implement.
    ///
    /// The lifecycle of a system is as follows:
    /// - Constructor: Called when the system is created, could be used for some early initialization
    /// - Init: Called when the system is initialized, at this point all the systems are created.
    /// - OnUpdate: Called every frame, this is where the system should update its state.
    /// - OnFixedUpdate: Called every fixed frame, this is where the system should update its state. Usually helpful for
    /// physics.
    /// - OnShutdown: Called when the system is shutting down, could be used for some cleanup.
    /// - OnRender: Called when the system should render, could be used for rendering.
    /// - Destructor: Called when the system is destroyed, could be used for some cleanup.
    ///
    /// Hooks are provided for all the lifecycle events, so the system can implement them as needed.
    ///

    /// updated. The game engine will sort the systems based on this value. Every time a new system is added, the engine
    /// will sort the systems based on this value. The engine provides 255 order slots, so the system can return any
    /// value between 0 and 255. Systems that belong to the same order will be updated concurrently.
